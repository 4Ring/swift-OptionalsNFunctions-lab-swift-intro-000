## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to..

* Complete this lab challenging them on their knowledge of functions and optionals.


## What the student can do at this point 

* Create variables and constants
* Is familiar with type annotations, type inference and string interpolation.
* Can create functions with return types.
* Is familiar with the String, Int, Double, and Bool type.
* Can perform arithmetic operations on Int and Double.
* Understands if and else clause statements.
* Knows how to work with Optionals
* Can work with functionals that make use of optionals.

## Outline / Notes

*  This could be anywhere between 10-15 questions.
* One question could ask them to calculate the min of an array and return back nil if the array is empty.... OR if the array only contains one item (actually, maybe not if it's one item.. what makes sense for the caller of the function to receive if they pass in an array with 1 item).
* It doesn't have to be too challengeing, but if you like you can make the last 2 very hard or something (not required). I think getting used to the syntax, how to create functions with Optionals, return types with optionals and how to handle calling functions like this is most important at this stage as opposed to be challenged to solve a problem.
